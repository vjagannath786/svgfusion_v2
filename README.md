# svgfusion

#### SVGFusion  is an advanced pipeline for generating high-quality Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) from text prompts. It builds upon the SVGFusion architecture and introduces modular improvements across the VAE, diffusion model, and decoder stages for more expressive and controllable vector image generation. ![SVGFusion v2 Pipeline](https://github.com/ximinng/SVGFusion/blob/master/assets/pipe.png)
